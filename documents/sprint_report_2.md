 * Store Page
 * Password Hashing
 * Logout functionality
 * Customer Cart, Add to cart
 * Update User details, delete user

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
We started with creating the home page for customer and admin so when the user logged in, the user session would be assigned accordingly. The password needed to be more secure, so we implemented password hashing so that database could not see the user's password. We implemented a create product feature in the admin home so admins can create products. We created the store page so all products are listed on the page. We implemented the cart so each customer has their own cart and on the store page they can add products to their cart. The cart page displays all products that the customer added.

## Unfinished Work
We completed most things we wanted to do. We are at a good 75% point with our project.
